`Hey Web Engineer. Welcome! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a ​single page app (SPA) using the mini TuneIn station API defined below​.`

Our goal here is to not trick you with a brain teaser but instead we try to promote a more relaxed, real-world setting which hopefully will allow you to show off your best work!

We value your time so this exercise has been designed so it can be completed in about 2 hours (we have also set our grading expectations to that). However, this is your take-home challenge so spend as little or as much time as you need to submit your best work. All we ask is don’t spend time making it pixel perfect. Spend your time on architecture, best coding practices and overall code quality.
We look forward to discussing and expanding your take-home challenge during our onsite interview.

`Your Task`

## Mini TuneIn API that returns a list of stations:

https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cdn-web.tunein.com/stations.json

● Be creative with this. We want to see a functional site that uses the api.
● The homepage of your app shows a list of available stations to play. You decide how
you want to order the stations and how they are displayed.
● A user should be able to click on a station in the list
● Once a station is clicked, details about the station should be displayed and the
associated stream should begin playing
● Be creative with tags. Can you help a user decide what to listen to based on tags?
● What can the reliability and popularity information associated with a station be used for?
● When in doubt, make an executive decision.
● Functionality is more important than the look and feel.
Once finished, please send your solution files or a github link to

## Some Tips

● We're happy to answer any questions so please feel free to email
madyanthaya@tunein.com
● Our web stack includes React, Redux, NodeJs and webpack but please use any languages, frameworks, or libraries you like. Pick something you are comfortable with. Whatever helps you show off your best coding skills!
● JSON Formatter chrome extension​ can be helpful while you’re formulating the architecture of your site.
● Assume you only need to only support modern evergreen browsers.
● Assume streams can be played with the html audio tag.
